description: Commit changes with a summary in point form
---

Review the current git changes and create a commit with a well-structured message that:

1. Check git status and git diff to understand all changes
2. Create a commit message with:
   - A clear, concise summary line (50 chars or less)
   - A blank line
   - Bullet points summarizing the changes, each referencing the specific files/folders involved
   - Use format: "- Description of change (path/to/file or folder/)"

3. Stage all relevant changes and commit with the generated message
4. Include the standard Claude Code footer at the end of the commit message

The commit message should be informative and make it easy to understand what was changed and where.
