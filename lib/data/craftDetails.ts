      "While other manufacturers pursued automation and modern materials, Omega made Mission-Critical Material Choices for reliability. The Manual Wind Reliability operates flawlessly in temperature extremes where automatics fail. The Hesalite crystal was chosen over scratch-resistant sapphire because it shatters into rounded pieces instead of dangerous shards in zero gravity. The core design remains Unchanged Since 1968 because it achieved mission-critical specifications—even the chronograph pusher resistance was precisely calculated to function with pressurized EVA gloves.",
