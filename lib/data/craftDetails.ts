      "While other manufacturers pursued automation and modern materials, Omega made deliberate choices for mission-critical reliability. The manual-wind movement operates flawlessly in temperature extremes where automatics fail. The Hesalite crystal was chosen over scratch-resistant sapphire because it shatters into rounded pieces instead of dangerous shards in zero gravity. Even the chronograph pusher resistance was precisely calculated to function with pressurized EVA gloves.",
